# au3-md5
 AutoIt3 MD5 implementation

 Converted from [JavaScript MD5 by blueimp](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5)

This is not the fastest way to md5, but it is pure AutoIt3.

I choose to make this UDF to allow some transparency about the inner workings of the hashing algorithm,
and to provide an alternative to the other implementaions that might be undesirable for various reasons.
