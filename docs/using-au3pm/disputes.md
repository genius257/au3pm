Handling Module Name Disputes

This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve module name disputes with other au3pm publishers. It also describes special steps you should take about names you think infringe your trademarks.

This document is a clarification of the acceptable behavior outlined in the au3pm Code of Conduct, and nothing in this document should be interpreted to contradict any aspect of the au3pm Code of Conduct.

### TL;DR
Create a new issue with the dispute

### Description
There sometimes arise cases where a user publishes a module, and then later, some other user wants to use that name.

### Exceptions
Some things are not allowed, and will be removed without discussion if they are brought to the attention of the au3pm registry admins, including but not limited to:

1. Malware (that is, a package designed to exploit or harm the machine on which it is installed).
2. Violations of copyright or licenses (for example, cloning an MIT-licensed program, and then removing or changing the copyright and license statement).
3. Illegal content.
4. "Squatting" on a package name that you plan to use, but aren't actually using. If someone wants to use it today, and you're just taking up space with an empty repository it will be removed.
5. Putting empty packages in the registry. Packages must have SOME functionality. It can be silly, but it can't be nothing. (See also: squatting.)
6. Doing weird things with the registry, like using it as your own personal application database or otherwise putting non-packagey things into it.
7. Other things forbidden by the au3pm [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/au3pm/registry/blob/master/conduct.md) such as hateful language, pornographic content, or harassment.

If you see bad behavior like this, please report it via a new Issue right away.

### Trademarks
If you think another au3pm publisher is infringing your trademark, such as by using a confusingly similar package name, creat a new Issue with the package name. Attach a copy of your trademark registration certificate.

If we see that the package's publisher is intentionally misleading others by misusing your registered mark without permission, we will transfer the package name to you. Otherwise, we will contact the package publisher and ask them to clear up any confusion with changes to their package's `README` file or metadata.
